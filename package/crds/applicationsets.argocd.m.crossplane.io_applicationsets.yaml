                                        This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                        Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                        Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                        Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                        Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                        Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                        Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                        This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                        Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                        Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                                  This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                                  Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                                  Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                                  Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                                  Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                                  RevisionHistoryLimit limits the number of items kept in the application's revision history, which is used for informational purposes as well as for rollbacks to previous versions.
                                                  This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                                  Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                                  Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.
                                                  Default is 10.

                                                  Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                                  Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                                  This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                                  Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                                  Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                                  This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                                  Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                                  Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                        This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                        Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                        Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                                  Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                                  Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                                A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
                                                relates the key and values.

                                                  Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                                  Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                                  Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                                  Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                                  Project is a reference to the project this application belongs to.
                                                  The empty string means that application belongs to the 'default' project.

                                                  RevisionHistoryLimit limits the number of items kept in the application's revision history, which is used for informational purposes as well as for rollbacks to previous versions.
                                                  This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                                  Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                                  Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                                  Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                                  Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                                  Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                                  Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                        RevisionHistoryLimit limits the number of items kept in the application's revision history, which is used for informational purposes as well as for rollbacks to previous versions.
                                        This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                        Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                        Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                        Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                        Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                  PullRequestGeneratorFilter is a single pull request filter.
                                  If multiple filter types are set on a single struct, they will be AND'd together. All filters must
                                  pass for a pull request to be included.

                                        Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                        Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                        This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                        Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                        Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.
                                        Default is 10.

                              RevisionHistoryLimit limits the number of items kept in the application's revision history, which is used for informational purposes as well as for rollbacks to previous versions.
                              This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                              Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                              Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.
