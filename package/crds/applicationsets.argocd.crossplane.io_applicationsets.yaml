                                        versions. This should only be changed in exceptional
                                        circumstances. Setting to zero will store
                                        no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                        Increasing will increase the space used to
                                        store the history, so we do not recommend
                                        increasing it. Default is 10.

                                        Increasing will increase the space used to

                                        versions. This should only be changed in exceptional
                                        circumstances. Setting to zero will store
                                        no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                        Increasing will increase the space used to
                                        store the history, so we do not recommend
                                        increasing it. Default is 10.

                                        versions. This should only be changed in exceptional
                                        circumstances. Setting to zero will store
                                        no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                        Increasing will increase the space used to
                                        store the history, so we do not recommend
                                        increasing it. Default is 10.

                                        no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                        Increasing will increase the space used to

                                        increasing it. Default is 10.

                                        revision history, which is used for informational
                                        purposes as well as for rollbacks to previous
                                        versions. This should only be changed in exceptional
                                        circumstances. Setting to zero will store
                                        no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                        Increasing will increase the space used to
                                        store the history, so we do not recommend
                                        increasing it. Default is 10.

                                        Increasing will increase the space used to

                                        versions. This should only be changed in exceptional
                                        circumstances. Setting to zero will store
                                        no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                        Increasing will increase the space used to
                                        store the history, so we do not recommend
                                        increasing it. Default is 10.

                              no history. This will reduce storage used. Increasing

                              we do not recommend increasing it. Default is 10.
